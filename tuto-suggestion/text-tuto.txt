A long time ago, technopriests made a pact with an unknown entity.
The entity granted them advanced technologies to sustain their population.
However, these structures are now crumbling, and the technopriests are no longer present.
If you don't act quickly, resources will soon be scarce.
Destroy seemingly useless buildings to free up space and replace them with low-tech resource providers.
Some buildings emit negative effects if not destroyed. Be cautious: demolishing a building may have unforeseen consequences.
Remember to read tooltips and attempt to replace your old resources with new ones before the timer expires. Good luck!
